# Project Name
Project 4: 2D Platformer: NINJA WARRIOR

Description:

The purpose of this project is to create a 2D platfomer game. To score 15 points, you will need to have a character that can move left and right (controlled by the keyboard) and jump. Your game will need to have enemies, platforms, and objects with which you can interact. The camera should follow the player. You will need to have a scoring system.

## Implementation:
[1 point] Assignment turned in on time

## Future Development

If I got the chance to work on this project again, I would first make sure to finish creating and implementing sound effects in the game, along with adding more enemy types to diversify gameplay for the player.  Adding a lives system, along with adding more juicy features would also help make the game look better as well.
